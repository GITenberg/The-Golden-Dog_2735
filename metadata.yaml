description: "The Golden Dog (Le Chien d'Or) was a novel by William Kirby (1817-1906)\
  \ that was written between April 1869 and 1872, with further revisions being up\
  \ through 1876. After being rejected by several publishers, the work was finally\
  \ arranged to be published in 1877 by Lovell, Adam, Wesson and Company. However,\
  \ because the publisher neglected to register the novel, the author lost any royalties\
  \ to this work. He received a sum total of $100–200 for the publication.\nThis novel\
  \ is based upon three works by James MacPherson Le Moine: The Golden Dog, Château\
  \ Bigot and La Corriveau. It draws upon the historical background of the city of\
  \ Quebec for its characters, and tells its story through two intertwining plotlines.\
  \ The first is of the lady Angélique de Méloizes, Madame de Péan, while the second\
  \ is of Coronel Pierre Philibert, the son of a prosperous merchant.\n From Wikipedia\
